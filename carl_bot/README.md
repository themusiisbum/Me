# Carl Chatbot

This is a simple AI chatbot named **Carl** implemented entirely with Python's
standard library. It uses basic pattern matching to generate replies, so no
machine learning libraries or external APIs are required.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

There are no external dependencies to install.

## Usage

Run the chatbot from the command line:

```bash
python carl_chatbot.py
```

Type your messages after the `You:` prompt. Type `exit`, `quit`, or `bye` to
leave the chat.
